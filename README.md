# Sockets
SERVER/CLIENT scripts in python
## The Basic Model of Networking
![](https://github.com/vulture990/Sockets/blob/main/server%26client.png)




This is just a basic network socket modeling between the server and a client just sending basic strings
i can also make more clients and make a small network so that each client sends to the server 
and the server can take care and send it to the other clients . 
We can send objets using the pickel module or json whish it gets little bit compicated,
definetly saving that one for later to dig into
